# A version upgrade of Venus Protocol (a block chain/financial product managed by a separate team of "community" developers) without the knowledge of Autofarm that introduced a new fee structure. "Although steps were taken to prepare for this event, our vaults were still unable to fully cater for this fee" and manual withdraw actions were required by users.

  # TODO: does this fit our definition of an "incident"?

  # AutoSAFU protocol insurance has shown its strength in trying times like this and hence, we will continue pledging the rebates which we receive monthly from Binance’s BUIDL reward program to the AutoSAFU.

  # excluded: no action proposed (part of finishing the response, maybe?)
  # TODO: This is a positive lesson perhaps?
    
  # We will scale on the number of moderators and volunteers to have a more holistic coverage across the communities and different time zones. This way, better customer support can be provided as required by the community.
