# Continuous delivery platform builds were failing for almost an hour since pods couldn't get AWS IAM credentials. A low request rate limit on a configuring process and the rapid creation and deletion of pods caused the configuring process to fall behind.

  # CDP builds were timing out and failing because Kubernetes builder Pods couldnâ€™t get AWS IAM credentials [because too many nodes started up for the very load qps setting on the kubernetes API server] To stop the bleeding, the cluster was manually scaled up so builder Pods would be spread over more than 1 node. For a permanent fix, the Kubelet QPS was increased from 5 (default) to 50 via a global cluster configuration.

  15-1:
    # TODO: Discuss if we want to code this property
    condition: Default QPS limit is low (matters when starting 20 nodes)
    
    event: Delay in updating new node status and so failing to get credentials
    Event: Scale up caused failure (slow to be add nodes during scale up)

    action: Increase request rate limit via global cluster configuration
    Action: Fix configuration / Increase request rate limit

    target: Cluster configuration (kubernetes API server ?)
    Target: Tech / Component / Cluster configuration / External system (open source)

    goal: Prevent delays in getting credentials (for newly started nodes)
    Goal: Prevent failure scenario / Reduce node start time
